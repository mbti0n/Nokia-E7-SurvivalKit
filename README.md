# Nokia E7 Survival Kit
Nokia E7 was released in 2010. People say that it was long obsolete, but for vintage phone collectors, this is a gem. And thanks to those passionate people, Nokia E7 is still rocking well in 2026, with some hacks and mods. I would like to share what I have done to my phone and the apps I am using to make it partially usable in today's world.

Disclaimer: I am not including ALL the games I installed in the list of apps. I only include one game that is newly made on Symbian. 

## ROM/Custom Firmware
**Delight | [Link](https://www.symwld.com/delight/)**
- Improved performance as it removes unnecessary apps from the stock ROM.
- It is hacked by default, meaning it is possible to install any SIS/SISX apps without certification errors; plus, it includes every patch possible in ROMPatcher+.
- It comes with more mods, both UX and UI-wise, thanks to the Delight App and other pre-installed system mod apps.

## IMPORTANT: 
**Please install the TLS 1.2 patch. Following [the guide here](http://nnp.nnchan.ru/tls/), credits to nnproject.** 

My recommendation is you should open the guide in Opera Mini because it is the only browser that the guide can be loaded on my E7.
What's improved after installing the TLS patch:
- No more "website certificate expired" pop-ups. This is more crucial when it comes to loading emails–images can be loaded INSTANTANEOUSLY without asking.
- It is possible to use today's RSS feed and podcast show URLs, as the majority of them are HTTPS-encrypted.
- The stock Web browser should load modern websites without relying on HTTPS proxy OR prompting errors because of old certificates.
