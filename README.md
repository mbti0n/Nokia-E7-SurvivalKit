# Nokia E7 Survival Kit
Nokia E7 was released in 2010. People say that it was long obsolete, but for vintage phone collectors, this is a gem. And thanks to those passionate people, Nokia E7 is still rocking well in 2026, with some hacks and mods. I would like to share what I have done to my phone and the apps I am using to make it partially usable in today's world.

Disclaimer: I am not including ALL the games I installed in the list of apps. I only include one game that is newly made on Symbian. 

## ROM
**[Delight](https://www.symwld.com/delight/)**
- Improved performance as it removes unnecessary apps from the stock ROM.
- It is hacked by default, meaning it is possible to install any SIS/SISX apps without certification errors; plus, it includes every patch possible in ROMPatcher+.
- It comes with more mods, both UX and UI-wise, thanks to the Delight App and other pre-installed system mod apps.

## IMPORTANT: 
**Please install the TLS 1.2 patch. Following [the guide here](http://nnp.nnchan.ru/tls/), credits to nnproject.** 
My recommendation is opening the guide in Opera Mini, because it is the only browser that the guide can be loaded on my E7.
What's improved after installing the TLS patch:
- No more website certificate expired pop-ups. This is more crucial when it comes to loading emails–images can be loaded INSTANTANEOUSLY without asking.
- It is possible to use today's RSS feed and podcast show URLs, as the majority of them are HTTPS-encrypted.
- The stock Web browser should load modern websites without relying on HTTPS proxy OR prompting errors because of old certificates.

## Apps that I am using or would recommend
### Music / Entertainment
- [JTube](https://nnp.nnchan.ru/jtube/): A working J2ME YouTube client on Symbian. Refer to this guide to use the correct working config...
- [MIDplay](https://github.com/phd051199/MIDPlay): A J2ME Spotify/SoundCloud/YouTube music client on Symbian.
- JukeBox: A working internet radio app on Symbian.
- [ClassiCube](https://nnproject.cc/cc/): A recreation of Minecraft Classic, ported to Symbian.
- Podcatcher: A working podcast app on Symbian.
- Music and FM Radio should work without any modifications.

### Productivity
- Email: Mailbox Creator, supporting Gmail and Yahoo. Following these guides' configurations to properly use emails.
- Google Maps: An app that does Google Maps things, it is actually an old version.
- [Translator](https://nnproject.cc/bingt/): Use simpletranslate instance with Google Translate result.
- Opera Mini: A faster, snappier web experience for Symbian devices. It also helps loading several pages that are unloadable on other web browsers.
