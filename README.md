# Nokia E7 Survival Kit
Nokia E7 was released in 2010. People say that it was long obsolete, but for vintage phone collectors, this is a gem. And thanks to those passionate people, Nokia E7 is still rocking well in 2026, with some hacks and mods. I would like to share what I have done to my phone and the apps I am using to make it partially usable in today's world.

Disclaimer: I am not including ALL the games I installed in the list of apps. I only include one game that is newly made on Symbian.

## ROM/Custom Firmware
**Delight | [Link](https://www.symwld.com/delight/)**
- Improved performance as it removes unnecessary apps from the stock ROM.
- It is hacked by default, meaning it is possible to install any SIS/SISX apps without certification errors; plus, it includes every patch possible in ROMPatcher+.
- It comes with more mods, both UX and UI-wise, thanks to the Delight App and other pre-installed system mod apps.

## IMPORTANT: 
**Please install the TLS 1.2 patch. Following [the guide here](https://web.archive.org/web/20251212194836/https://nnproject.cc/tls/), credits to nnproject.** 

What's improved after installing the TLS patch:
- No more "website certificate expired" pop-ups. This is more crucial when it comes to loading emails–images can be loaded INSTANTANEOUSLY without asking.
- It is possible to use today's RSS feed and podcast show URLs, as the majority of them are HTTPS-encrypted.
- The stock Web browser should load modern websites without relying on HTTPS proxy OR prompting errors because of old certificates.
